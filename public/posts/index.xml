      <description>&lt;p&gt;Four years ago, I was working as a &lt;strong&gt;mechanical engineer&lt;/strong&gt;, focused on systems, machines, and processes that you could physically see and touch. It was a solid career—and one I’m still proud of—but something inside me felt restless. I was curious about tech, fascinated by the digital world, and increasingly drawn to the idea of working in &lt;strong&gt;cybersecurity&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/images/Pasted%20image%2020250423140314.png&#34; alt=&#34;Image Description&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Today, I work as an &lt;strong&gt;IAM (Identity and Access Management) Engineer&lt;/strong&gt;. I won’t pretend I have it all figured out. Most days, I still feel like a &lt;strong&gt;beginner&lt;/strong&gt;—and in many ways, I am. But I’ve come far enough to look back and say: I’m glad I took the leap.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
