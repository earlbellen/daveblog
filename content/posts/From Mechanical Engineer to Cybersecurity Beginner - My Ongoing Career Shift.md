Four years ago, I was working as a **mechanical engineer**, focused on systems, machines, and processes that you could physically see and touch. It was a solid career—and one I’m still proud of—but something inside me felt restless. I was curious about tech, fascinated by the digital world, and increasingly drawn to the idea of working in **cybersecurity**.

Today, I work as an **IAM (Identity and Access Management) Engineer**. I won’t pretend I have it all figured out. Most days, I still feel like a **beginner**—and in many ways, I am. But I’ve come far enough to look back and say: I’m glad I took the leap.

### Why I Took the Leap

Like a lot of career shifters, I didn’t start with a degree in Computer Science or any formal training in IT. What I had was **curiosity** and a desire to build something different for myself. I started learning online, asking questions, saying yes to small tasks at work, and leaning into the uncomfortable feeling of not knowing.

When I landed my first opportunity in IT, I kept going. I slowly found my way into **Cybersecurity**, specifically in **IAM**, where I help manage who gets access to what in an organization. It’s a mix of logic, security, and structure—and while I’m still growing into the role, I love where it's heading.

### What This Blog Is About

I’m starting this blog not as an expert, but as a **fellow learner**. If you're thinking of switching careers, starting fresh, or just curious about tech—I’m writing this for you.

You’ll find posts about:

- What it’s like to shift into tech from a different field
    
- Tips for beginners learning cybersecurity and IAM
    
- Study resources, small wins, and lessons from my journey
    
- A bit of lifestyle too—especially fitness, which keeps me grounded
    

### The Gym and the Journey

I’ve always enjoyed going to the gym. In fact, lifting weights played a huge role in shaping my mindset during the career shift. It taught me about **consistency, delayed gratification, and showing up even when it’s hard**. I don’t hit personal records every day—but I show up. The same goes for my tech journey.

### You Don’t Have to Be an Expert to Start

This blog is about starting, not arriving. I’m not here to teach from a podium—I’m here to **walk alongside** those who are figuring it out, just like I am.

So if you’ve been hesitating to try something new, to learn a new skill, or to start over—consider this your sign. You don’t have to be an expert. You just have to start.

Let’s figure it out together.
