*davenearl@localhost:~$ whoami*

I'm **Daven Earl Bellen**. I started out as a mechanical engineer and found my way into cybersecurity, where I now work in Identity and Access Management. I'm still learning as I go—and this blog is my way of sharing what I’ve picked up along the way. If you're exploring tech or shifting careers, you're in the right place. 

## What I Do

### Leveling up with cybersecurity learning platforms:

| Platform       | Link                                                                                                                                                         |
